Synopsis
========
This is an efficient C++ implementation of a polynomial time approximation 
algorithm to solve multicommodity flow problems [1]. The implementation 
follows basically [1] but with the "binary search" in the second part
(while solving the so called "min-cost max concurrent flow" problem)
improved as described in [2].
This implementation is meant to provide a clean and simple interface (for 
easy integration in bigger projects) for specifying the network (or graph) 
and the supplies and demands (or commodities).


Credits
=======
This code is an incomplete porting to C++ with "extraction", restructuring,
and clean-up of the MCF code written by Yuanfang Hu, Hongyu Chen, and Yi Zhu
(while at UCSD as students of Chung-Kuan Cheng). Their code is discussed 
in [2] and can be downloaded from here:
http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/kuan/supercomputer/supercomputer_package.tar


Installation
============
The latest version of the tool can be downloaded from:
www.dejazzer.com/software.html
To compile it just type:
> make


How to use the tool
===================
Usage:  mcf_solver network_file [Options...]
Options:
        [-problem_type MCF|MCMCF]. Default is MCMCF.
        where: MCF - max multicommodity flow, MCMCF - min-cost max concurrent flow
        [-epsilon float]. Default is 0.1.

Examples:
> mcf_solver tests/toy1.network -problem_type MCF
> mcf_solver tests/toy1.network
> mcf_solver tests/toy2.network -problem_type MCF
> mcf_solver tests/toy2.network
> mcf_solver tests/toy2.network -problem_type MCF -epsilon 0.01

Things I need yet to do
=======================
1. Clean-up more all classes: have all class-variables as "_variable"
and not just "variable"; encapsulate everything: make all class-variables 
private and provide access functions; get rid of dubious constants such as
"400" inside shortest_path() routine;
2. Get rid of all malloc's; for that use vectors for all arrays
3. Implement MCF::build_network_from_host_application() - this should be 
very easy for anyone


Things you might want to do
===========================
1. If you dig into it and find any bug, please let me know
2. If you use this code in a research project and want to 
include a reference to it, then please use:

3. If you'll ever hit it big (to be read: make a lot of money :-) ),
and this code helped you in any way, then please consider 
donating some to support my research (I need it :-) )
